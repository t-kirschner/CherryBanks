# CherryBanks
Project for university lecture. Represents simple bank account system in OOP.

To run the Kotlin application on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you must first ensure that you have the required development tools and libraries installed. These include:

- The Java Development Kit (JDK): This contains all the tools you need to compile and run Java code. You can download and install the JDK from Oracle's official website.

- The Kotlin Compiler Plugin: This plugin adds the ability to compile Kotlin code to the JDK. You can install the plugin either from the command line or from your development environment.

Once you have installed the required tools, you can run the Kotlin application as follows:

- Open a command line and navigate to the directory where the "Main.kt" file is located.

- Run the "kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime -d Main.jar" command to compile the Kotlin file into a Java archive (.jar file). This command also creates all the required classes and resources to run the application.

- Run the "java -jar Main.jar" command to run the application. You should now see the Main Menu of "CherryBanks".

If you are using a development environment such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can also run the Kotlin application directly from the development environment by executing the Run or Debug command.

Have fun banking!
